# CASbot

**Notice:** This bot was archived, but has now been unarchived. Rather than starting from scratch again, I will convert my codebase to use discord.py instead of Nextcord.

CAS's main Discord bot, CASbot.

Features:
* `/kanyequote` - Get a random Kanye West quote
* `/doge` - Get a random Shiba Inu image
* `/usernote` - Set and retrieve user-linked notes
* `/neko` - Get a random anime catgirl image
* `/colortext` - Make custom colored code blocks with new ANSI markdown support

More features coming soon include more APIs, AI images, and (maybe) moderation support.

The bot is currently not public, because commands are manually assigned to servers, and the bot is still mainly for testing. If you want to try out the bot, feel free to reach out to me on Discord (see my GitHub bio).

***Note:** This repository was formerly `discord-bots`, and it ran multiple bots. Now, this is handled through separate repositories.*
